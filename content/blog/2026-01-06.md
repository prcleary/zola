- Testing out a new [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) blog using the [tabi-start](https://github.com/welpo/tabi-start) template - feels pretty Spartan at the moment
- When I first started working with public health colleagues abroad, it was easiest for me to automate surveillance reporting using R and Markdown, but it could subsequently be fiendishly difficult to hand those processes over for colleagues to run, so I have been trying to extract the maximum analytical value from DHIS 2 ever since. The always wonderful [EyeSeeTea](https://eyeseetea.com/) have created an [add-on](https://github.com/EyeSeeTea/dashboard-reports/) for DHIS 2 which allows you to convert a DHIS 2 dashboard into an (editable) Word document. Unfortunately it seems that the (now unsupported) 2.39.5 version of DHIS 2 that we have does not work with the add-on. There is some guidance in the README suggesting that you can extract JavaScript files from the DHIS 2 WAR file and include them in the app, but I am hoping an upcoming upgrade will sort this issue out for me. 
- I think I am getting closer to an integration solution for the global health work, or at least an MVP, and I think it is quite exciting. I will add my notes to the [Notes](@/notes/_index.md) section when it is more developed.
- Current most-used tech at the start of 2026:
  - Server: Minisforum MS 01 running Proxmox, Nextcloud AIO, Karakeep, Paperless GPT, Vaultwarden; I've stopped using SearXNG as it kept getting blocked; lots of Cloudflare Tunnels currently, plus a demo information system running behind Nginx Proxy Manager; backed up to [BorgBase](https://www.borgbase.com/) but I really should be using [Proxmox Backup Server](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-backup-server/overview); BPC Energy UPS
  - Desktop: MOREFINE S500+ AMD Ryzen Mini PC R7 6810U CPU Windows11 Pro Dual R45\*2 LAN NVMe SSD Gaming PC HD DP Type-C WiFi Desktop Computer, which cost £240 off alibaba.com but has been pretty solid; running Pop_OS! (have not yet upgraded to latest version - I really like it)
  - VPS hosting: MIAB (recently upgraded), and Rustdesk relay server (to access my Mum's laptop)
  - Phone: OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite which has been fine; it is a bit small for reading for me now so I have also ordered an Android tablet
  - I also recently switched from Gmail (after decades) to Proton equivalent services, which are fine
  - I have also got a standing desk (converter really) and a four computer KVM switch so I am now unstoppable
