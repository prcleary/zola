- Just a quick post - I'm going to try to blog little and often in future
- I've always known it was possible to create rates in [DHIS 2](@/notes/DHIS2/_index.md), but it was more work than I expected when I came to do it; I've put my notes [here](@/notes/DHIS2/incidence-rates-in-dhis-2.md) as there were a couple of things I had to work out in the process; it's not difficult though
- The University of Oslo does a lot of good webinars about DHIS 2, so I've been trying to catch up with some of them recently; there was a [particularly good one](@/notes/DHIS2/implementation-considerations-infrastructure-dhis-2-academy.md)) about infrastructure considerations for DHIS 2
- I have found a [good way to back up servers off-site](@/notes/Selfhosting/backing-up-servers-and-desktops-with-borgmatic.md) that might be useful for the global health work
- I've finally got a new home computer! it is a mini-PC that I bought off alibaba.com and it's actually great - will add my setup notes at some point
- Finally, I have been looking into app frameworks recently, as we have a need for an incident tracker of some kind and I am not sure shoehorning into DHIS 2 is the best approach; I had been planning to learn Plone to see if I could come up with anything useful with that, but I've just discovered the Frappe Framework which is also Python-based (based on Flask I think) and might be a better bet and so I'm playing with that: [Frappe: Open Source Software](https://frappe.io/)
