Excellent webinar from the University of Oslo on the advantages and disadvantages of different options for hosting DHIS 2, the open-source health information management system; also useful on the open-source software skills needed for implementation (which many IT people won't have if their experience has been in commercial contexts); advice on having separate development, staging, production and training instances, and separate instances for tracker and aggregate systems; accessible and non-technical approach
