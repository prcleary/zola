Hi! 👋  

This is my blog, built with **Zola** and the **tabi** theme.

I'm an epidemiologist working in UK public health and global health.  I use this blog/wiki mainly as a technical reference for myself.

I am interested in many things, including:

- Epidemiology (natürlich)
- Developments in statistics and related areas
- Programming: R, Python, now Rust
- Open-source software, self-hosting, cybersecurity
- Global health informatics

I used to have a different blog - you can still access it [here](/oldblog.html). I am gradually moving any useful stuff over.
